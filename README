Think Like A Programmer(tlap)
C++ is the starting point of my long and enjoyable journey.
The current roadmap includes Calclus 2, Assembly and basic Electronics.
Assembly is something like a rifle, that is, you can get another piece of different brand working pretty quickly once the basics is mastered.
Recently I've been working on as Assembly course with Mr. Gustav Pezzi, which is something like archaeology but fun. It's almost finished, and I need to replay it and internalize.
